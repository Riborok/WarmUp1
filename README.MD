# WarmUp №1. Monks

### Task:
![The task](https://i.imgur.com/WCvOI2s.png)

>The program calculates the combination of groups of monks in order for all the pies to be eaten.

#### Language: Delphi

## There are 2 variants: using one cycle and two cycle

---

### Code using one cycle:
#### The disadvantage of this variant is the inadmissibility of entering the same amount of eaten pies for simple and apprentices.
``` pascal
Program WarmUp1OneCycle;

{
 There are 3 groups of monks: leading, simple and apprentice.
 Introduced how many monks and how many pies.
 Also introduced how much each monk eats.
 The program must calculate the combination of monks.
}
